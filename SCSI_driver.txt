1 Introduction
==============

This is the driver for following controllers:
 
    SAS 5 Controllers
    SAS 6 Controllers


2 Compatibility / Minimum Requirements
======================================

This Device Driver is compatible with RHEL 5.
This Device Driver is compatible with SLES 10.

Minimum SAS 5 FW package version: 00.10.51.00.06.12.04.00

3 Installation Instructions
===========================


3.1 The package.
----------------

The driver package consists of a compressed tar file.  

To extract the compressed file in the tar file, 
first, uncompress the file:
	"> gunzip <driver_package.tgz>"
then, un-tar the files: 
	"> tar -xvf <driver_package.tar>"
	
NOTE: The first step is not needed on SLES10 & RHEL5 systems.
      Files extension change when uncompressed (*.tgz->*.tar)
	
The package should contain the following files:
 - dkms rpm (dkms<version>.rpm)
 - driver rpm (mptlinux<version>.rpm)
 - release notes (*.txt)
 - source code (megaraid<version>src.tgz)
 - driver update disk (DUD) image for the different OSes (*.img)

Preparation of the DUD image.  Transfer the image to the floppy:
	Use "> dd if=<image_file_name> of=/dev/fd0"

On most systems, the floppy drive is designated by the /dev/fd0 special file.
It is recommended that the dd command is executed before the floppy is mounted.


3.2 Installing the Linux driver during an OS installation
----------------------------------------------------------

- Installing the driver on a Red Hat Enterprise Linux system -

Perform the following steps to install the RHEL 5 driver
using the DUD:

1  Boot normally to the RHEL installation media.
2  At the command prompt, type:
		> Linux expert dd
3  When the install prompts for a driver diskette, insert the 
   driver update disk (DUD) prepared earlier and press <Enter>.
4  Complete the installation as directed by the installation program.

- Installing the driver on a SuSE Enterprise Server system - 

Perform the following steps to install the SLES 10 driver 
using the DUD:

1  Boot normally to the SLES installation media.
2  Select <F5> for the driver update disk on SLES 10 installations.
3  Select Installation from the menu.
4  Press <Enter> to load the Linux kernel.
5  At the prompt insert the driver update disk and follow instructions.
6  Complete the installation as directed by the installation program.


3.3 Adding/Updating the SAS Driver to an Existing Linux system
--------------------------------------------------------------

1  Install the DKMS rpm package if needed. Use this command: 
      "> rpm -ivh <dkms rpm package name>"
   
   NOTE: Use rpm -Uvh <package name> when updating an existing package.
   
2  Install the Driver package. Use this command: 
      "> rpm -ivh <driver rpm package name>"

3  Verify the driver has been loaded with this system command:
      "> lsmod mptsas"
   and this dkms command:
      "> dkms status"
   The version shown in the output should match in both cases with 
   the version of the package.


4 Fixes or Enhancements in this Release 
=======================================

1  Added support:
    - For SAS 6/iR controllers.
    - To report a deleted RAID volume to upper layers when a 
      firmware event is received saying that the volume has been disabled.
    - To display port link speed.
    - Xen kernel
    - Additional kernel modes (precompiled binaries)
    - For installing RPM after a DUD install on RHEL5.
2  Hot plug functionality:
    - Enhancement to re-queue event on 5 second intervals for 
      1 minute until the device is found in the topology. 
    - Handling improvements to decrease the impact of keyboard 
      availability when many drives are added and removed. 
4  Improvements of RAID event handling for hidden RAID components and 
   for RAID events scheduling.
5  Fixed a problem with volumes becoming read-only when one disk from 
   a RAID1 volume was pulled.
6  Timing and reset handling improvements to avoid configuration 
   problems at startup.
7  Fixed memory management problems to avoid memory leaks at driver 
   load time under some conditions.
8  Changed memory allocation to input/output buffer to manage 2kb buffers 
   without stack overflow problems.


5 Important Information
=======================

5.1 Power state transition
--------------------------
Note that system power state transitions are not validated on Dell 
platforms under the Linux Operating Systems. If attempted, the 
system might hang and/or panic resulting in data loss.

5.2 DKMS AUTOINSTALL
--------------------
DKMS AUTOINSTALL option should always be disabled in the DKMS 
configuration file for driver installation.


6 Known issues
==============
Installation problems on SATA I drives: SAS Controllers require a minimum 
of SATA II drives.  SATA I drives are not supported.  Use only SAS or 
SATA II drives supported by your Dell system.

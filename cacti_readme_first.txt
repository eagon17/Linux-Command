This document assumes that you have a Linux box with

*** Absolutely NO OPTION AVAILABLE !!! ****

that means I like lean Linux.

No crontab, No sudo, No man, No make to begin with.

If you chose some options during the Linux installation process,

you may skip some of my shown process.

PDF file is the instruction I found from Google.

But it contains some wierd charactors that Linux command line doesn't recognize.

So, I made my own set of command lines.

You can just copy & paste from my Cacti_installation.txt file.

After completion, it shows some bug caused by version mismatch. (this is my guess)

Thumb-nail images are not showing.

So, if you fix this, please let me know.
